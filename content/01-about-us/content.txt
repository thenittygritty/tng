----
Text: Hans Christian Reinl and Kahlil Lechelt founded The Nitty Gritty as a place for themselves and their friends to publish technical articles about web technology.

The motivation stems from the wish of having all those well researched articles archived in one place and to have standing invitation to post at any time to certain developers who don't have and/or want to maintain a personal blog.

It is the goal to establish TNG as a trusted place for web developers to find well-researched quality content that improves their understanding of and their abilities in web technology.

If you want to publish an article for TNG, please [contact us](contribute). We are thankful for any serious contributions.
