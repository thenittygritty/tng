The usual workflow when releasing a Node lib or Bower Component looks something like this, [Dave Geddes](https://github.com/geddski) thought:

> * bump the version in your package.json file.
> * stage the package.json file's change.
> * commit that change with a message like "release 0.6.22".
> * create a new git tag for the release.
> * push the changes out to github.
> * also push the new tag out to github.
> * publish the new version to npm.

But what if you only need to run a one-liner in Terminal?

	$ grunt release

That's what grunt-release does for you!
