> In July 2012, my blog had 100 subscribers. Two months later, I made $12,500 in sales in just one day. It turns out that you can start without an audience and still find success. Iâ€™ll assume you are starting from scratch, like I did.

Great article on how to launch your own product even with out an initial audience.
