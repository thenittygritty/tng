ExcerptIntro: 

LOL, JK. &mdash; What is not a joke though, is that the [Distilled Hype](http://distilledhype.com/) link blog is being integrated into The Nitty Gritty.

Since I started Distilled Hype in early 2012 I have received a lot of positive feedback from people I respect throughout the industry.

What is not a joke though, is that the [Distilled Hype](http://distilledhype.com/) link blog is being integrated into The Nitty Gritty.

Since I started Distilled Hype in early 2012 I have received a lot of positive feedback from people I respect throughout the industry. But it turns out that to maintain two websites that are very similar in nature and purpose doesn't make a lot of sense, it creates extra work, splits up the audience unnecessarily and as a consequence of these to brands competing, both suffer in quality.

So [@drublic](http://twitter.com/drublic) and I decided to integrate link postings into The Nitty Gritty. Starting on May 15 2013, TNG will be featuring link posts just like Distilled Hype did.

Since I grew very fond of the Distilled Hype brand, I am not shutting it down but making distilledhype.com my personal website and [@distilledhype](https://twitter.com/distilledhype) my personal Twitter handle.

I hope you will find this addition to TNG useful. Please let us know what you think on Twitter. We would love to discuss your ideas.
