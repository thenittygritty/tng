Images are the most bandwidth-consuming parts of our web pages.

Addy Osmani states:

> Images are a non-trivial problem to solve because they occasionally need to be high-res, but at the same time small enough to not kill your users mobile data cap. 

But luckily we have tools to help us optimize images and thus the experience of our users.

> Where possible, it’s best to try automating image optimization so that it’s a first-class citizen in your build chain.

Addy collected a list of tools and helpers to create this automatization process.
