> This presentation looks at several ways to integrate Backbone.js into your WordPress themes and plugins, including a step-by-step demonstration of how Backbone improves the quality of your existing jQuery code. It also walks through other exciting ways to use Backbone alongside WordPress, including how to make a standalone Backbone application that only uses WordPress for its data.

Backbone is the perfect tool to clean up your jQuery plugin code. This talk is very Wordpress specific but the principles can be applied to any site.
