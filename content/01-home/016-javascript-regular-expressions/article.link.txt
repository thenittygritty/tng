> It wasn't until I re-adjusted my thoughts on the nature of regular expressions that my fear of them turned into pleasure. This happened when I started thinking about regular expressions as an actual language itself, instead of a value contained within a language. I know it is not technically a language, but studying it like a programming language might just help a developer get over the steep learning curve.

A very comprehensive tutorial on regular expressions. Love it!
