[Dimi Navrotskyy](https://github.com/dypsilon) collected a huge list of Front-End related links and resources.

> If I have a specific development task the workflow for me looks like this:
>
> * Search through Google, Github, Unheap, npm, bower, jster and so on.
> * Compile a list of useful packages and tutorials for every one of them.
> * Select the best package for the task.
>
> So I created this list to not have to go through step #1 and #2 every time.
