> Take the (link:http://codepen.io/bradfrost/full/mlyvu text:footer-anchor pattern), for example. I really, really like this pattern. It doesnâ€™t require any JavaScript whatsoever; just a simple hyperlink from the top of the page that links to the fragment identifier of the navigation at the bottom of the page. It works on just about every device.

Hey, I didn't know this pattern. It's awesome and it lends itself so well to progressive enhancement as (twitter: adactio) explains so well in his post.
