> The only way I see of creating a different world is if we suceed in moving open source beyond the realm of über geeks to create a third alternative to design‐led closed source and features‐lead open source: design‐led open source.

I am so stoked that the vision that (link: http://thenittygritty.co/the-future-of-the-web-a-draft text: Bastian laid out six months ago on TNG) is now being picked up by other great designers with the full intent to build this thing!

Also, I am very happy that (twitter: aral) (link: https://twitter.com/aral/status/352770228133961730 text: mentioned Bastian's article on Twitter) and that they are talking.

To me this is all about making the things we use every day work beautifully in the way the web naturally works. Decentralized. It is what makes a system incredibly resilient and empowering. The fact that great designers are now inspired to build this and the idea of design-led open source is exciting to say the least.
