The BackboneConf videos are up. Lots of really great speakers here. After just watching a few videos it is interesting to see the development that Backbone is going through. The emphasis was on large-scale applications and in his keynote, Jeremy is addressing lots of the criticism Backbone has received from the Ember corner. Although not explicitly.
