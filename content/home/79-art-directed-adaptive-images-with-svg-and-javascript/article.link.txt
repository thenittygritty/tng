> In an ideal world we would have an image format that integrated “dynamic crop marks”, allowing a single source image to adapt to different requirements while preserving its central focus. While we don’t have such a feature yet, we do have SVG’s viewBox attribute, which comes awfully close.

While this solution isn't the best perfomance-wise, it's a pretty clever idea.
