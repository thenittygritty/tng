**If you are using a text file based blogging software like (link: http://jekyllrb.com text: Jekyll), (link: http://getkirby.com text: Kirby) or (link: http://middlemanapp.com text: Middleman) you probably were annoyed at some point to manually have to create your text file with correctly formatted file and/or folder name including post-specific meta data.**

I surely did, especially in the case of link blogging since you tend to post multiple links in a short amount of time and because these posts are really short you don't want to spend a lot of time on them.

We use Kirby for TNG and in order to create a new link post we have to create a new folder which has a specific naming pattern and a text file that also has a specific name and contains some meta data. I love Kirby and managing my content in text files but, boy, that is tedious!

## Enter grunt-textfile!

I am happy to announce the release of (link: http://github.com/kahlil/grunt-textfile text: grunt-textfile) today. If you use (link: http://gruntjs.com text: Grunt) in your project anyway it is very easy to add and configure for your specific text file based content management needs.

After you configured the plugin in the Gruntfile all you have to do is to call the task on the command line with the desired options i.e.:

<span class="language-bash"></span>

	grunt textfile --title="grunt-textfile Is Where It's At!"

Head over to (link: http://github.com/kahlil/grunt-textfile text: the repo) and check it out.

Let me know about any bugs or feedback in (link: http://github.com/kahlil/grunt-textfile text: the issues).

## Writing grunt-textfile

Man, I &hearts; Grunt to death, yo.

It is amazing how powerful and flexible it is. The documentation is really great now  and the API gives you a lot to work with. I specifically made use of the `grunt.template` and `grunt.option` methods.

`grunt.template` takes care of processing the text file templates and since the grunt object is available within the template you can use the grunt API right there in the template. This means it allows you to insert things like `grunt.template.today('yyyy-mm-dd')` or `grunt.option('link')` into the template. No extra parser to write.

To create the slugs for the file or folder name, I am using (link: http://stringjs.com text: String.js). It is a very capable string manipulation library that's worth checking out.

## Conclusion

If you manage your blog's content in text files I hope you give grunt-textfile a try. Let me know if you run in to any problems or miss any features.
