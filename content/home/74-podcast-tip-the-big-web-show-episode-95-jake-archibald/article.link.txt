> Jeffrey Zeldman interviews Jake Archibald of Google Chrome about upcoming web caching standards, how the network connection is merely a layer of progressive enhancement and why you should build your app offline, communicating with non-developers, accessibility standards at BBC and The Guardian, the forking of Webkit, native versus web part 99, and why the much-linked article "Why Mobile Web Apps are Slow" proves no such thing.

I didn't know there was a jQuery plugin that plugs requestanimationframe into jQuery animations. Great episode! Excited to see whats coming in respect to the new web caching standard.
