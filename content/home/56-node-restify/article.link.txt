> restify is a node.js module built specifically to enable you to build correct REST web services. It intentionally borrows heavily from express as that is more or less the de facto API for writing web applications on top of node.js.

A great alternative to Express for your Node Backend if you want to build a client-side app. It seems like Express is a little bloated if you just really want an API.
